# wfevents — standalone monitord → workflow-monitor JSONL plugin

A [pegasus-monitord entry-point plugin](../../docs/PLUGIN-AUTHORING.md) that
translates the live stampede event stream into
[workflow-monitor](https://github.com/pegasus-isi/workflow-monitor)-native
JSONL records, written to **`wfevents.jsonl`**. With the plugin host's
`tick()` support it can also absorb the HTCondor queue/history/pool polling
that `workflow-monitor --serve` performs — all from inside the monitord
process, no extra daemon.

It is a standalone extraction of workflow-monitor's `wfmonitor` adapter
(pinned at `de0c9482ec8c`, branch `monitord-plugin-adapter` — see
[`SOURCES.md`](SOURCES.md)) with zero runtime dependencies. The record schema
is identical; workflow-monitor's `DATA_SOURCES.md` is the authoritative
contract.

## Requirements

- A Pegasus build with the monitord plugin host: branch
  [`monitord-plugin-system`](https://github.com/pegasus-isi/pegasus/tree/monitord-plugin-system),
  minimum commit `f929618c649aabc3d21b96dce45ff38919578c26` (adds `tick()`,
  required for `condor_poll`).
- Python ≥ 3.9. For condor polling: the HTCondor CLI tools on `PATH`
  (subprocess fallback) or the optional `htcondor` Python bindings
  (`pip install 'pegasus-monitord-plugin-wfevents[htcondor]'`).

## Install

Install into the interpreter that `pegasus-monitord` resolves (on a typical
submit node, the system `python3`):

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user \
  'git+https://github.com/mjstealey/pegasus-monitord-plugins.git#subdirectory=plugins/wfevents'
```

Verify the entry point is discoverable by that same interpreter:

```bash
python3 -c "from importlib.metadata import entry_points; \
  eps = {e.name: e for e in entry_points(group='pegasus.monitord.plugins')}; \
  eps['wfevents'].load(); print('wfevents OK')"
```

## Configure (per run, in `pegasus.properties`)

```properties
pegasus.monitord.plugins.wfevents.enabled = true
pegasus.monitord.plugins.wfevents.events_path = /abs/path/to/run/wfevents.jsonl
# optional: poll HTCondor from inside monitord via the plugin host's tick()
pegasus.monitord.plugins.wfevents.tick_interval = 5
pegasus.monitord.plugins.wfevents.condor_poll = true
```

| Key (`pegasus.monitord.plugins.wfevents.`) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Required `true` to load the plugin (host-reserved) |
| `events_path` | `./wfevents.jsonl` | Output JSONL path. Relative to monitord's working directory — **use an absolute path** |
| `restart` | `false` | `true` truncates the file at start; default appends |
| `tick_interval` | `0` | Host-reserved; > 0 enables `tick()` (seconds). Required for `condor_poll` |
| `condor_poll` | `false` | Poll condor_q / condor_history / condor_status from `tick()`, emitting `htcondor_poll` / `htcondor_history` / `pool_status` events (fingerprint-deduped) |
| `schedd`, `collector` | — | Non-default pool targets |
| `token_path`, `cert_path`, `key_path`, `password_file` | — | HTCondor credential passthroughs (not needed on FS-auth pools) |
| `queue_size` | `10000` | Host-reserved: bounded event queue, drop-on-overflow |
| `join_timeout` | `10.0` | Host-reserved: shutdown join timeout (seconds) |

## Consume with the workflow-monitor TUI

Live, over SSH, from any machine that can reach the submit node:

```bash
workflow-monitor --remote user@submit-host:/abs/path/to/run/wfevents.jsonl --sync-interval 5
```

(The TUI does an initial `ssh cat`, then incremental `ssh tail -c +offset`
syncs; it is filename-agnostic — the first record is always `workflow_start`,
which is what it keys on.)

Local replay of a finished run:

```bash
workflow-monitor --replay /path/to/wfevents.jsonl --speed 4
```

**Double-poll caveat:** if `condor_poll = true` here, run any standalone
`workflow-monitor --serve` with `--no-condor-poll` so the schedd is not
polled from two places.

## Behavior notes

- Condor cadence: queue polled per due tick behind an adaptive backoff;
  history at ≥ 3× the tick base (min 10 s); pool at ≥ 5× (min 15 s); one
  final flush of all three on `stop()`. Queries are always scoped to the
  workflow (a `Cmd` prefix match on the planner's submit dir) and never run
  before `wf.plan` supplies it.
- `wf_uuid` is the first `xwf_id` seen by this plugin instance. Hierarchical
  workflows run one monitord per sub-workflow — give each its own
  `events_path`.
- A monitord restart in append mode (the default) appends a second
  `workflow_start` mid-file; the TUI tolerates this. `restart = true` is the
  clean-slate knob.
- Coexists with workflow-monitor's `wfmonitor` plugin (distinct entry-point
  names and property namespaces) — just don't point both at the same
  `events_path`.
- For deploying onto a FABRIC Pegasus/HTCondor slice (plugin-host overlay on
  an apt-installed Pegasus, Vector shipping, ES indexing), follow the
  procedure in fabric-deployments' `deploy/MONITORD-PLUGIN.md`, substituting
  this package's pip install and the `wfevents.*` property namespace.

## Develop

```bash
cd plugins/wfevents
uv run pytest -q          # or: pip install . pytest && python -m pytest tests -q
uv run python tests/synthetic_run.py /tmp/wfevents.jsonl   # demo file for the TUI
```
